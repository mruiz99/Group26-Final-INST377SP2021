# North America vs Japan, A Look Into Popular Video Game Genres and Sales
### Description
When our team came across the chance to design a front-end for a database about video games, there was no need for any more discussion.  Our web application will display information pertaining to video game sales across three decades mainly showcasing which genre of video games were the most popular.  Our database contains information going back to 1990 all the way up to 2010.  Casual gamers, professionals, or those whos simply enjoy videogames and history will be able to witness how the preference of specific genres have changed over time.
